	       				Ever since its incarnation in the summer of 2007, the annual Vancouver Taiwanese Film Festival has worked to bring the latest and the greatest, or sometimes even the hidden gems, of the Taiwanese film industry across the pacific waters. What started as a simple vision, a courageous leap into the unknown, has now matured into a staple that Vancouverites anticipate each year. Many may recognize the TWFF logo Bigeye from videos and fliers, or even the wall mural in a skytrain station. Bigeye has not only become a beloved symbol of the TWFF but also our club.

	       				Vancouver is widely known as a city of multiculturalism. Our goal vision began as, and     remains a simple one. We hope to build bridges that not only allow for cultural transcendence, but also promote a deeper understanding of Taiwanese arts to local audiences. We hope that by bringing more attention to these often overlooked Taiwanese films can not only raise more cultural awareness, but also provide those who are interested, a window into Taiwan.
